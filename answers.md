Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

.map - returns/creates a new array, with the results of calling a function on every element of an array.  



What is the difference between a function and a method?
Method is defined as the property of an object and is a function defined inside the object.
    eg: let obj = {name: "John", age: 32, speak:function(){return 'hi'}};
Function is defined outside of an object and will be executed when called. 



What is closure?
A closure is a function where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function's has closed.


Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
1.  Window Binding: Window binding of 'this' has a global function and is default. It occurs when function is called without any rules. 
2.	Implicit Binding: Implicit binding of 'this' occurs when function is called by a preceding dot to invoke a function.
3.	Explicit Binding: Explicit binding of 'this' occurs when .call(), .apply(), or .bind() methods are used on a function.
4.	New Binding: Whenever a constructor function is used, 'this' refers to object that is created and returned by the constructor function.



Why do we need super() in an extended class?
Super is a function which calls the constructor of the base class inside of a sub class.  It avoids duplicating the constructor that is common between base and extended class.
